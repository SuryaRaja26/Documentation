Variables:
-----------
data types are actually classes and variables are instances (object)
Python is not “statically typed”. We do not need to declare variables 
Eg:
C=1 or c="Surya" (variables are case sensitive)

Rules for Python variables
----------------------------
* must start with a letter or the underscore character.
* only contain alpha-numeric
Single or Double Quotes?
-------------------------
We can use both but in double quotes we can use single quoute inside double quotes.

x="surya's"

Get the Type
------------
Type() function used to get the type of variables

print(type(s))

Explict casting
---------------
* When we convert float to int, the decimal part is truncated.
* We can’t convert a complex data type number into int data type and float data type numbers.

Python Assign Values to Multiple Variables 
---------------------------------------------
Assign simultaneously values to variables
a=b=c=10; or a=b=c=1,"surya",10;

Concatenation
-------------
if you add string value it will cancate
a="surya"
b="raja"
c=a+b

if you concate different types it will show error
eg:
a=20
b="surya"
c=a+b -> Error

Global keyword in Python
-------------------------
user to modify a variable outside of the current scope. used to create global variables from a non-global scope i.e inside a function.
x=1
print(x)
def fun():
    global x
    x=x+1
    print(x)
fun()
print(x)
Rules
------
* no need to use a global keyword in Python outside a function.
* If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within the function’s body, it’s assumed to be local unless explicitly declared as global.

Different Data types
---------------------
1)Numeric:
They are immutable data types, which means that changing the value of a number data type results in a newly allocated object.
 Three types:
 1.1)int
	int is the whole number, including negative numbers but not fractions.
 1.2)float
	real number with a floating-point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. 
	If two int types are divided it will produce float value
 1.3)complex
 
2)String
 The 0th element will be the first character of the string whereas the -1th element is the last character of the string.
 String Slicing:
 One thing to keep in mind while using this method is that the string returned after slicing includes the character at the start index but not the character at the last index.
